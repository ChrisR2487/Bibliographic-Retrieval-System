# Bibliographic-Retrieval-System

A project I built for my Data Structures class. It involves a class that will keep a linked list of documents id's, in sorted order. The id's will represent the documents in which a particular word appears. These linked lists could be used to perform searches for documents that contain a particular word, documents that all words in a collection, documents that contain at least one word from a collection, and so on.
